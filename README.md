# DataWorks! Salons
![DW Salons Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90872869/145872352-74ca2597-3b11-4fdb-82a5-3f1c6877529c.jpg "DataWorks! Salon Icon")

FASEB DataWorks! Salons are conversation spaces for the biological and biomedical research community to exchange ideas and design effective practices for data sharing and reuse.  These virtual meetings and workshops are designed to engage community members, support discussion, and provide learning experiences.  

There is no specific format for a DataWorks! Salon - the duration, setting, and host will depend on the topic, audience, and goals, so long as the event engages participants in explorative conversation to share and increase collective understanding and inspire action.  Salons can be internal to FASEB, limited to specific organizations, or open to the community.

## Salon Schedule
**7 October 2021:  LAUNCH!! Team Spirit: Help your team reach data nirvana.**  [Registration closed]
This event launches the DataWorks! Salon series.  It promotes learning and use of team data sharing protocols and charters, gathers community input on team-based data sharing that can inform DataWorks! and FASEB science policy initiatives, and starts the process of recruiting teams for the OpenScapes/FASEB Champions cohort.

**8,9,10 November 2021:  What Data Should be in my NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan?**  [Registration closed]
This Salon engages NIH-funded researchers and learn about what data types they generate and use; what kinds of data are relevant for inclusion in in an NIH data management plan (DMP); and to triage what data types require more guidance to enable effective data management protocols.  See summary here: [What data go into my DMP.pdf](https://github.com/FASEB-DataWorks/Salon/files/7706321/What.data.go.into.my.DMP.pdf)

**14 December 2021:  Announcing the DataWorks! DMP Challenge.**  [[Register!](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtcOqspz4rH9S3sQhb12cYb-5tI4ttaJCX)]
Data Management Plans (DMPs) play an integral role in ensuring that data are collected, organized, stored, and shared responsibly. Biomedical and biological researchers writing such plans frequently ask for examples of excellent DMPs that incorporate their data types and specific storage, access, and IP requirements. To respond to this need, and to celebrate excellence in managing and sharing biomedical and biological data, we are excited to announce the DataWorks! Data Management Plan Challenge.

**SAVE THE DATE: 19 January 2022: Launching DataWorks!**
FASEB DataWorks! staff will provide an overview of the DataWorks! initiative, introduce partners.  A great opportunity to share your ideas and help prioritize goals for the coming year. 

**SAVE THE DATE: 10 February 2022: What Funders Can Do to Support Data Sharing and Reuse.**
Funders can support data sharing and reuse in many ways.  The Health Research Alliance and Children's Tumor Foundation join us to showcase their activities to support data sharing, through direct expert support and researcher recognition. 

## Code of Conduct

To encourage free discussion, it is understood that DataWorks! Salon participants are free to voice their individual opinion, which may may not be those of their organizations. 

FASEB's Catalyst Conference [Code of Conduct](faseb.org/Portals/2/PDFs/SRCs/SRC%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf) applies to all DataWorks! Salon participants. FASEB expects professional conduct of all attendees, and asks all participants to help us ensure a safe and positive experience for everyone. By registering for a DataWorks! Salon, the participant agrees to abide by the Code of Conduct.

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such  we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding to support the Community and Prize programs.
