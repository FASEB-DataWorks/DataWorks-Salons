# DataWorks! Salon

![Salon Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90872869/134727332-4df1f2db-c174-4289-acfe-f367faef145d.png "DataWorks! Salon Icon")

FASEB DataWorks! Salons host critical conversations about data sharing and reuse.  These virtual meetings and workshops are designed to engage community members, support discussion, and provide learning experiences.  Our goal is to build a social fabric to support and recognize researchers for sharing and reusing data.

There is no specific format for a DataWorks! Salon - the duration, setting, and host will depend on the topic, audience, and goals, so long as the event engages participants in explorative conversation to share and increase collective understanding and inspire action.  Salons can be internal to FASEB, limited to specific organizations, or open to the community.

## Salon Schedule
**7 October 2021:  LAUNCH!! Team Spirit: Help your team reach data nirvana.**  [Register](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMscO6trjsrEtXnAumLngDhotvEG-NvNyaS).  Created in collaboration with [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org).

## Code of Conduct

To encourage free discussion, it is understood that Salon participants are free to voice their individual opinion, which may may not be those of their organisations. 

FASEB's Catalyst Conference [Code of Conduct](faseb.org/Portals/2/PDFs/SRCs/SRC%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf) applies to all DataWorks! Salon participants. FASEB expects professional conduct of all Salon attendees, and asks all participants to help us ensure a safe and positive experience for everyone. By registering for a Salon, the participant agrees to abide by the Code of Conduct.

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such  we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding for the Capacity Program and the Catalyst Prize.
