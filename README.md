# DataWorks! Salon

![Data Salon Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90872869/133941277-713114ba-b184-4507-9299-eef94fd3007d.png "DataWorks! Salon Icon")

FASEB DataWorks! Salons host critical conversations about data sharing and re-use.  These virtual meetings and workshops are designed to engage community members, support discussion, and provide learning experiences.  Our goal is to build a social fabric to support and recognize researchers for sharing and re-using data.

There is no specific format for a DataWorks! Salon - the duration, setting, and host will depend on the topic, audience, and goals, so long as the event engages participants in explorative conversation to share and increase collective understanding and inspire action.  Salons can be internal to FASEB, limited to specific organizations, or open to the community.

## Salon Schedule
**7 October 2021:  Team Spirit: Help your team reach data nirvana.**  [Register](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMscO6trjsrEtXnAumLngDhotvEG-NvNyaS).  Created in collaboration with [OpenScapes](https://openscapes.org).

## Code of Conduct

To encourage free discussion, it is understood that Salon participants are free to voice their individual opinion, which may may not be those of their organisations. 

FASEB's Catalyst Conference [Code of Conduct](faseb.org/Portals/2/PDFs/SRCs/SRC%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf) applies to all DataWorks! Salon participants. FASEB expects professional conduct of all Salon attendees, and asks all participants to help us ensure a safe and positive experience for everyone. By registering for a Salon, the participant agrees to abide by the Code of Conduct.

# What is DataWorks!

The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology [FASEB](https://faseb.org) is a non-profit federation of 30 biological and biomedical science societies, representing nearly 150,000 researchers.  Over the last decade, FASEB has been working with its member societies to enhance research transparency, rigor, and reproducibility.  FASEB DataWorks! comes directly from these community efforts, and aims to drive a vision of a world where all researchers re-use data. DataWorks! is designed to be open and self-sustaining and is initially funded by a US$1.5m investment by the FASEB Board.

# DataWorks! programs: Conversation Spaces, Training, Peer Support, and Prizes

Culture change is complex work. Building a social fabric to support and recognize researchers for sharing and re-using data is a long-term investment. To ensure we are providing what the community needs and that we evolve as the culture changes, FASEB is taking an incremental approach.  We are launching DataWorks! program pilots over the next 12 months, the first of which is the Salon (October 2021), followed by a fellows program to develop capacity (January 2022), a challenge prize to catalyze action (2022), and a help desk and knowledgebase to support ongoing learning (2022-3).

# Why FASEB?

FASEB is uniquely positioned for this work.  As a federation, we have the scope and experience to engage across our member societies on cross-cutting topics, of which data sharing and re-use is an excellent example. We are skilled at creating conversation spaces and willing to experiment with new strategies to advance health and well-being.  We promote research and education in biological and biomedical sciences.  And, we bring over 100 years of coalition building as a respected collaborative community advocate and voice of the researcher. 

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and re-use ecosystem, and as such  we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding for the Capacity Program and the Catalyzing Data Re-Use Prize.
